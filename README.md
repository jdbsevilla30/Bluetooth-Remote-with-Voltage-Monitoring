Battery Monitoring and Control System
This project implements a battery monitoring and control system that uses a voltage sensor, a relay module, and a Servo motor. The system is controlled by an app developed using MIT App Inventor and transfers data to the app like a serial monitor.

Features
Measures the voltage of the battery and displays it on the app
Controls a relay module using the app
Controls a Servo motor using the app
Getting Started
To run this project, you will need the following hardware components:

Arduino board
Voltage sensor
Relay module
Servo motor
In addition to the hardware, you will need the following software components:

MIT App Inventor to develop the control app
Arduino IDE to upload the code to the Arduino board
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/[username]/Battery-Monitoring-and-Control-System.git
Connect the voltage sensor, relay module, and Servo motor to the Arduino board as per the code.
Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
Compile and upload the code to the Arduino board.
Develop the control app using MIT App Inventor and connect it to the Arduino board.
Usage
Launch the app and connect it to the Arduino board.
You will see the voltage of the battery being displayed on the app.
You can control the relay module and the Servo motor using the app.
